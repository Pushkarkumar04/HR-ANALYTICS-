Project: Employee Attrition Analysis using Power BI

I analyzed HR data containing 1480 rows and 38 fields, including attributes like Attrition, Employee ID, Age, Department, Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Monthly Income, and Years at Company.

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Cleaned the data in Power Query Editor by removing duplicates, handling null/missing values, and correcting inconsistent entries.

Created derived columns such as Age Group and Salary Slab for better categorization and analysis.

2. Data Analysis using DAX:

Calculated key KPIs using DAX:

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Average Age of Employees: 37 years

Average Monthly Salary: ₹6.5K

3. Key Insights:

Identified that employees earning up to ₹5K/month had the highest attrition count (163 employees).
